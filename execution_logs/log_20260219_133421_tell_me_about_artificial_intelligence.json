AI can be categorized into two main branches: narrow AI (also known as weak AI) and general AI (also known as strong AI). Narrow AI focuses on specific tasks and is limited to those areas, while general AI aims to create a machine capable of performing a wide range of cognitive tasks.\n\nReferences:",
