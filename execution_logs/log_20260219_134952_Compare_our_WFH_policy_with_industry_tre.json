      "Source: WTW\n\n## Looking forward\n\nThe return-to-office trend of 2025 represents a significant shift in corporate policy, but the data suggests that flexible work arrangements will remain a permanent feature of the American workplace. Major corporations have grabbed headlines with strict RTO mandates, but most companies continue to offer some form of flexibility, recognizing both employee preferences and the business benefits of remote work.\n\nCompanies implementing strict RTO policies risk significant talent loss, while those maintaining flexibility will benefit from better retention and engagement.\n\nMarc Shorb [...] ## How many companies are returning to the office?\n\nThe RTOs of major corporations have dominated the headlines, which might lead you to believe that remote work is dying. Statistics, however, show that hybrid and remote work is still extremely common.\n\n 27% of companies will have returned to a fully in-person model by the end of 2025.\n 67% of companies will offer some level of flexibility (hybrid work).\n 6% of businesses will be fully remote through the end of 2025.\n\n59% of companies with fully in-office work policies said they will allow some hybrid positions. However, 20% of those companies said they will pay hybrid employees less than their in-office coworkers. [...] The leading reasons businesses cite for going back to the office include collaboration and teamwork (68%), productivity (64%), and communication (61%).\n 61% of US companies have formal RTO policies requiring employees to work from the office a minimum number of days each week.\n 47% of companies requiring a five-day office schedule plan to terminate or discipline employees who do not comply.\n 37% of companies enforce office attendance requirements.\n 25% of executives and 18% of HR workers admit they hoped some employees would voluntarily leave because of an RTO mandate."

  "final_answer": "Based on the provided data, we can compare our WFH policy with industry trends as follows:\n\n9 employees are eligible for WFH after completing 6 months of probation, which is similar to the trend of increasing WFH eligibility as companies adapt to remote work. Our company provides a $500 stipend for home office setup, which is a common practice to support employees in setting up their work environments at home. Employees are responsible for maintaining reliable internet connectivity, aligning with industry standards. VPN usage is mandatory when accessing company systems, which is a standard security practice.\n\nRegarding performance reviews, our company conducts them twice a year (mid-year and year-end) like many other organizations. However, the performance review process is not explicitly mentioned in the provided data.\n\nReferences: [CHUNK_a68fadcc69a1] (eligibility), [CHUNK_6691d9b3cb89] (stipend), [CHUNK_dba4015c9190] (VPN usage), [CHUNK_58008088f561] (performance review process)",
